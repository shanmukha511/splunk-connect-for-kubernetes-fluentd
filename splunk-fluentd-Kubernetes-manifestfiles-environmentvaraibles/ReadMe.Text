Need to install fluentd as deamonset in kubernetes cluster to send application logs to splunk and restrict logs for namespace required.
Manifest files like configmap, deamonset are there and text file of enviromnet varibles has to provided in order to pass them to configmap and daemonset.
Once environment varibles are ready like splunk token ,Host , namespace logs which has to displayed and application log file location has to be given.
Once have values need to create secret by using file and we will env variables via secrets.
Command to creat secret "kubectl create secret generic splunk-kubernetes-logging  --from-env-file=test.txt -n prd"
Once secret got created need to create configmap and daemonset.
